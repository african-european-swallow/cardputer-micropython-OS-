# cardputer-micropython-OS-
A Micropython "OS" that can easily be modified.



I am not the best at coding so most of the code will be of a beginner level.
To start off I did use code from echolalia: https://github.com/echo-lalia/Cardputer-Micropython-Examples.

The sd file should be put on a sd card of crappy quality (faster ones do not work), if you choose to not use a sd card remove the .wav files to save storage space.
